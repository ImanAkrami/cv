## Work History

### Avid Arvand

->_UAI (remote) / Iran_ <br/>
**Web Developer and Tech Lead** <br/>
_January 2020 to present_ <br/>

- attended and participated in designing the architecture and data model of the new large-scale, exam app which had to support multiple global standards and dynamic and not limited to the k12 system.
- Applied solutions for requirements such as multi-tenant, multi-lingual, burst-like user behavior, and infrastructure issues ( because of the lack of AWS and similar services) in the country.
- worked with the designer to translate technical and business requirements to UI/UX designs in Figma.
- resolved multi-level caching problems for the large-scale app and set up a caching strategy from the client-side to CDN, to Redis, and in-pod memory cache while developing a cache invalidation for different resources and scenarios in mind.
- utilized Jotai, a modern atomic react state manager to handle client state management in the project.
- used Apollo client with its middleware pattern to set up retry, serialization, batching and error handling.
- built type-safe GraphQL, and rest APIs.
- used BullMq to handle calculation or I/O heavy operations such as exam result calculation in jobs or high amounts of burst requests in the exam process.
- participated in the design and implementation of social features to the app by handling client-side and server-side connections to another micro-service of the company.
- optimized client-side performance by profiling, using best react practices, and using Nextjs static generation when possible.
- ran and oversaw load tests using Fargate and k6 to assess the app's behavior under large loads.
- Wrote unit and integration tests for the product.
- Designed a multi-level review process to use as both a quality control tool as well as an educational one.
- used SonarCube to ensure code quality and embedded it into the team's review process.
- used and contributed to an in-company UI library using semantic versioning, babel (and later SWC) build tools, and resolving some Commonjs/ES-modules problems for publishing packages.
- configured Webpack in order to add custom loaders, handle some NPM modules differently, and so on.
- held short weekly meetings with the developers of the team to gather feedback on how the project can be technically improved from the POV.
- greatly reduced task completion time by writing a self and peer-review checklist as well as communication protocols between team members to reduce lag time, especially for remote developers.
- created a fun gamified experience to peer rate co-workers in retrospective meetings.
- utilized design tokens as a modern way for giving control of the app design to the UI designer.

**Junior Web Developer** <br/>
_January 2020 to January 2021_ <br/>

- worked on a project with a relatively legacy tech stack ( old react, rare compiled language, custom home-made solutions such as state management, no linter, no formatter)
- developed new features while having a relatively large user base in mind (120k).
- worked on microservice architecture, NoSQL database, class-based React, and Socket.io as the base of client/server communications.
- Added third-party services to the app ( Covid era ), like Jitsi video conference support, analytics, in-app student support, and logging.
- 6 months in, started helping new developers by code reviewing and pair programming.

## About Me

There is a reason I have chosen to switch to programming as a career, even though I was indeed successful in my (unmentioned) Architectural Technology career. I am in love with learning and education. The first question I've asked from any employer is, will there be room for me to grow? will there be people and environments to challenge me to the extremes? I learned to read by myself at the age of 4, and I do believe if there was a mission for a person on earth, mine would be learning and solving problems. <br/>
my previous job didn't have that, not for me at least. in programming, I saw an opportunity to solve problems and enjoy doing them, as well as actually being encouraged to do what I love, learn new things, and improve what I already know. This is probably what helped me grow pretty fast in my job and be promoted to the tech lead of the team. I don't have any delusions, I need to learn a lot. but I still think this quality, that I love what I do, and that I have a passion for, should be important for my employer. someone who loves his job is bound to produce higher quality products than someone who doesn't. <br/>
So, If you think someone who has a passion for improving and life-long learning, and applying what he learned to the product and passing it on to his co-workers is an ideal employee, I am indeed your person. <br/>
